                    <h2>Actual Real Reviews (Authentic, Honest, Sincere, Genuine)</h2>
                    <h3>**Review 1: ★★★★★ - "Explosively Entertaining!"</h3>
                    <p>Firebald is the bomb! Literally. From the moment I launched this game, I was hooked on the adrenaline-pumping action. The top-down perspective adds a unique twist to the survival genre, and the fiery landscapes are nothing short of breathtaking. The graphics are so realistic that I almost felt the heat of the flames on my screen! The gameplay is intense, and the dynamic fire mechanics keep you on your toes. It's a real blast to play! <br> - John Carmack</p>
                    <h3>**Review 2: ☆☆☆☆☆ - "Atrocious"</h3>
                    <p>I do not like this game because it does not have story-driven, crafting, walking simulator, buzzword (replace this later), emergent gameplay, inclusion, battle pass, live service, esports-ready features <br> - Jimothy Dummass (pronounced doom-awh), Polygon</p>
